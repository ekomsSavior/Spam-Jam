🔥 Spam Jam is a powerful, open-source Bluetooth attack toolkit for security researchers & ethical hackers.

It features:

✅ BLE Spamming 💌 (Send custom BLE spam messages)

✅ BLE Jamming 🚫 (Overload BLE devices with junk packets)

✅ L2Ping Attacks 💥 (Bluetooth ping flood)

✅ RFCOMM Flood 🔥 (Spam Bluetooth connections)

✅ Full Bluetooth Device Scanning 📡

NEW BLE MESH BOTNET SYSTEM

✅ Mesh Botnet Mode – Broadcast commands across BLE bots

✅ Beacon Mode – Turn any device into a mesh node

✅ Real-Time Scanning + Bot Discovery

✅ Persistent mesh_nodes.txt file (MAC, Name, RSSI, Timestamp)

✅ Optional Recursive Chaining – Bots rebroadcast messages

✅ Command Parsing: spam_mode, jam, scan, chain, etc.

✅ Self-Growing – Bots scan for and save new bots

✅ Continuous Broadcast Loop Mode

✅ Extend range using chained bots over time

✅ Full mesh registry stored for easy editing

🛠️ Installation (Kali Linux)

Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/ekomsSavior/Spam-Jam.git

cd Spam-Jam

Step 2: Install Dependencies

sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y bluez bluez-tools python3-pip

sudo apt install python3-bluepy

Step 3: Run Spam Jam

sudo python3 spamjam.py

🚨 Root is required for Bluetooth attacks! Always use sudo.

To update Spam Jam at any time:

git pull


🎯 Menu (Current Version)

🔹 0 BLE Advertise All 💣

🔹 10 Quit 🚪

🧠 Mesh Network Menu (🌐 Option 7)

The BLE Mesh Botnet is Spam Jam's secret weapon.

Any BLE device can become a mesh bot. These bots

Broadcast their presence with a custom alias (e.g. SpamJamMesh_XXXX)

Receive & execute mesh commands: spam_mode, jam, scan

Optionally rebroadcast commands to extend the network!

mesh menu options 

🔹 1. Scan + Add Mesh Bots (Advanced Menu)

🔹 2. Load Saved Mesh Bots

🔹 3. Broadcast Command to Bots

🔹 4. Become a Mesh Bot (Beacon Mode)

🔹 5. Quit

✅ Scanning gives you full control — filter by name, RSSI, Scan in sequence and more.

✅ Saved bots are written to mesh_nodes.txt with MAC, name, RSSI, and timestamp.

✅ Commands sent to bots are delivered via BLE write and executed based on the message.

💡 Command Examples for Mesh Bots

After selecting a bot or "all", enter a command

spam_mode → Performs BLE spamming to nearby devices

jam → Sends random junk packets (BLE jamming)

scan → Scans for more nearby bots to grow the mesh

chain → Repeats this command to other bots it discovers 

📡 This allows mass coordination of BLE attacks with no central C2. Each bot becomes a repeater!

🧪 Experiment Ideas for Advanced Users

Turn your entire lab into a BLE botnet swarm using old phones, Raspberry Pis, or dongles

Create rogue mesh nodes pretending to be real IoT devices

Use scan + chain to recursively map a BLE landscape

Attach physical GPS or CSI logging to beacon nodes for BLE signal analysis

Write your own mesh command payloads (future extensibility coming!)

⚠️ Legal Disclaimer

Spam Jam is for educational and research use only.

Unauthorized use on networks or devices you do not own is illegal.

Be ethical. Be responsible. Hack the planet with heart. 💜
